## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why should I prefer an electronic receipt?

Every year, in the United States alone, producing paper receipts takes about 1 million liters of oil, uses a million liters of water, destroys 10 million trees, generates 2 billion kilograms of carbon dioxide, and causes 137 million kilograms of solid waste. Take into consideration that most of the paper receipts are checked only once and then end up in the trash. Besides, the paper receipts are coated with BPA (Bisphenol A), a plastic chemical that is presumed to cause cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and premature puberty. The paper receipts also increase the COVID-19 contamination by increasing contact at the supermarkets. Moreover, the receipts are very hard to store, carry and keep track of.

### I don’t have cellular data. Will QRegister still function?

Yes. You will be able to view your receipts right away, even if you are disconnected. Once you connect to the internet, your receipts will be saved safely.

### If I delete QRegister, will my previous receipts be deleted?

No. We are keeping your old receipts saved and safe. If you ever remove the app and re-download, your receipts will still be available.
